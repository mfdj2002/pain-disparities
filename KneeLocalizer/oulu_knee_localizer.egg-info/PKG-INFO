Description: # Code for the paper from SCIA'17: A novel method for automatic localization of joint area on knee plain radiographs
        
        # Description
        Repository contains the code for an automatic knee joint detection on plain radiographs. It can be used to process very large amount of knee X-rays and generate bounding boxes (up to 6 000 000 per day on a high-end computer).
        
        Our package processes the data in a batch mode using multiple threads. To run in on your machine, you have to install the conda environment. For that, simply execute `create_conda_env.sh`.
        
        # How to run
        Run the script as follows:
        ```
        cd oulukneeloc
        python detector.py --path_input <dir with DICOM files> \
                           --fname_output <file to write the results>
        ```
        
        Script will produce the bounding boxes of 120mm and save it to the specified file
        (by default, `../detection_results.txt`).
